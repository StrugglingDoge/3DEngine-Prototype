# 3DEngine-Prototype
 A C# MonoGame 3D Engine Prototype.

This project was used to get learn a more general, lower-level understanding of creating a 3D space by the use of multiple view matrices to project a 2D environment into a 3D space. 

Not only that but this project also introduced me to implementing & using ImGUI.

 - Application can load OBJ models and apply textures accordingly.
 - Camera can freely fly around the 3D space.
 - ImGUI is implemented to control camera controls & debug the 3D world.

## Building this Project
 To build, this project might need a bit of tweaking as this was using a forked version of MonoGame to be able to develop and run on ARM-based machines.
